# Minecraft ServerChecker 
Simple tool made in python, to check minecraft servers (beta)
# How to install? 
1. `git clone https://github.com/MILKv2/serverchecker.git`
2. `cd serverchecker`
3. `python3 main.py`

Used https://api.mcsrvstat.us/ in this project.
And since im not the best in python, i used some tools like Chatgpt for help.
